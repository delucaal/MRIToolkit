%function [M] = epg_FZ2spins(FpFmZ, N, frac)
%
%	Function returns a 3xN array of magnetization vectors [Mx My Mz].'
%	that is represented by the EPG state FpFmZ.  Note that the 
%	magnetization assumes that a "voxel" is divided into N states,
%	as is necessary to make the conversion.  N must be at least 
%	as large as twice the number of F+ states minus one.
%
%	INPUT:
%		FpFmZ = F,Z states, 3xQ vector where there are Q states,
%			where rows represent F+, F- and Z states starting at 0.
%		N = number of spins used to represent the states.  Default
%			is minimum.
%		frac = (optional) fraction of state to increment/decrement
%			so if frac=1, this is equivalent to first passing
%			FpFmZ through epg_grad().  This is mostly just 
%			to make plots.
%		
%	OUTPUT:
%		M = [Mx My Mz].' representing magnetization vectors.
