N = 200;	% Number of Sequence repetitions.
TR = .01;	% 10ms

F = [0;0;1];	% Equilibrium Magnetization.
		% [F+; F-; Z],  all longitudinal in Z0 state.


S1 = zeros(N,1);
S2 = zeros(N,1);

for k=1:N
  F = epg_rf(F,pi/6,0);		% RF Rotation.
  S1(k) = F(1,1);		% Record "Signal"

  S2(k) = F(1,1);		% Record "Signal"
